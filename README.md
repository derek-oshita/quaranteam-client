## Quaranteam

Website: CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

10/18 - The API for this application is deprecated and is currently being rebuilt.

Quaranteam is a full-stack application built for the sole purpose of flattening the curve during the 2020 pandemic. In a time of relentless uncertainty, it is important for us to band together and make conscious decisions driven by relevant and comprehensive data. 

By relaying data from covidtracking.com, Civil.Services, and our users, we hope to provide transparency into how every state has handled the current state of affairs. 

## Technologies Used

Front End: 

- React
- Ant Design 
- Animate.Style
- JWT-Decode

Backend: 

- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- CORS
- DOTENV
- Nodemon
- JSONwebtoken

## Installation

Quaranteam separates the front-end and backend. It is important that all dependencies are installed at the root level of each directory (npm i). Both servers must be initiated in order to run this application, you'll find the React Library uses localhost:3000 on the front-end and localhost:4000 on the backend (npm start). 

## User Story

A user is defined as anyone who creates an account and interacts with my application. Users will find helpful datapaoints around COVID-19 provided by Covidtracking.com to help them stay informed and metadata from Civil.Services. They are encouraged to post feedback around this data in order to spread awareness of their own, first-hand experience.
